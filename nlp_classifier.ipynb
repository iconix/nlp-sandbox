    "**Hypothesis**: Part of Speech (POS) tagging and syntactic dependency parsing provides valuable information for classifying imperative phrases. The thinking is that being able to detect imperative phrases will transfer well to detecting tasks and to-dos.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Some Terminology\n",
    "- [_Imperative mood_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imperative_mood) is \"used principally for ordering, requesting or advising the listener to do (or not to do) something... also often used for giving instructions as to how to perform a task.\"\n",
    "- _Part of speech (POS)_ is a way of categorizing a word based on its syntactic function.\n",
    "    - The POS tagger from Spacy.io that is used in this notebook differentiates between [*pos_* and *tag_*](https://spacy.io/docs/api/annotation#pos-tagging-english) - *POS (pos_)* refers to \"coarse-grained part-of-speech\" like `VERB`, `ADJ`, or `PUNCT`; and *POSTAG (tag_)* refers to \"fine-grained part-of-speech\" like `VB`, `JJ`, or `.`.\n",
    "- _Syntactic dependency parsing_ is a way of connecting words based on syntactic relationships, [such as](https://spacy.io/docs/api/annotation#dependency-parsing-english) `DOBJ` (direct object), `PREP` (prepositional modifier), or `POBJ` (object of preposition).\n",
    "    - Check out the dependency parse for the phrase [\"Send the report by Kyle by tomorrow\"](https://demos.explosion.ai/displacy/?text=Send%20the%20report%20by%20Kyle%20by%20tomorrow&model=en&cpu=1&cph=1) as an example\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features\n",
    "The imperative mood centers around _actions_, and actions are generally represented in English using verbs. So the features are engineered to also center on the VERB:\n",
    "1. *FeatureName.VERB*: Does the phrase contain VERB(s) of the tag form VB*?\n",
    "2. *FeatureName.FOLLOWING_POS*: Are the words following the VERB(s) of certain parts of speech?\n",
    "3. *FeatureName.FOLLOWING_POSTAG*: Are the words following the VERB(s) of certain POS tags?\n",
    "4. *FeatureName.CHILD_DEP*: Are the VERB(s) parents of certain syntactic dependencies?\n",
    "5. *FeatureName.PARENT_DEP*: Are the VERB(s) children of certain syntactic dependencies?\n",
    "6. *FeatureName.CHILD_POS*: Are the syntactic dependencies that the VERB(s) are children of of certain parts of speech?\n",
    "7. *FeatureName.CHILD_POSTAG*: Are the syntactic dependencies that the VERB(s) are children of of certain POS tags?\n",
    "8. *FeatureName.PARENT_POS*: Are the syntactic dependencies that the VERB(s) parent of certain parts of speech?\n",
    "9. *FeatureName.PARENT_POSTAG*: Are the syntactic dependencies that the VERB(s) parent of certain POS tags?\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that features 2-9 all depend on feature 1 between `True`; if `False`, phrase vectorization will result in all zeroes."
