1) The enforceability of my existing contract with Enron, namely section 16.  What happens to my contract with Enron and will I be forced to repay both my sign on bonus and my retention bonus to Enron?	neg
2) Section 1(f) and the last sentence of section 1(c) seem redundant.  Will I get paid the retention bonus absent voluntary termination (i.e. for both with cause and without cause involuntary termination) ?	neg
3) Who will be my employer?  And will all stock and stock option grants be in UBS AG stock?	neg
4) What happens to the Restricted Stock grant referenced in Section 2 and again in Exhibit I if UBS terminates me with or without cause?  As a follow up,  if the stock is lost then what is the consideration for signing this contract (non - compete)?	neg
5) In Section 9(a), the non - compete clause is set up for a 12 month period after my employment begins and continues regardless of termination both voluntarily and involuntarily.  What is to stop UBS from terminating me or anyone else for that matter immediately after signing this agreement?  All they are out is the Retention portion of the contract (since contract is at will).	neg

Here's a cut at the taxonomy of regulatory risks associated with Direct Access. Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.	neg
1. Retroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date  between July 1 and September 20th.	neg
2. Contract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.	neg
3. No incremental "DASR'ing":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the  suspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)	neg
4. Cost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.   Costs with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund,  and DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial.	neg
Key risks associated with each category:	neg
Adverse to P/L	neg
Adverse to hedge (demand risk)	neg

THIRD EXTRAORDINARY SESSION CALLED	neg
Governor Davis has called a special session on Tuesday, October 9 to consider and act upon legislation affecting the operation, maintenance, finances, and financial viability of investor-owned utilities that provide electricity or natural gas to California residents and businesses, including their procurement portfolios and practices, and service by alternate energy providers in their service territory.	neg
Extraordinary (Special) Session Rules and Procedures	neg
Call of Special Session:	neg
Only the Governor has the authority to convene a special session of the Legislature. In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon.	neg
Election of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals:	neg
The election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees.	neg
Identification of Special Session Bills and Publications:	neg
Separate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper.	neg
Introduction of Special Session Bills:	neg
There is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session.	neg
Special Session Bill Procedures and Calendars:	neg
There is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the "30-day in print" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session.	neg
Effective Date of Special Session Legislation:	neg
Simple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature.	neg
End of Special Session:	neg
Only the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto.	neg
FYI.  Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA "stampede"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.	neg
Best,	neg

CONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY	neg
Pace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed	neg
Quite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible.	neg
Instead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved.	neg
Chairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts.	neg
Freeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind.	neg
With the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves?	neg
Kellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State.	neg
Flukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers.	neg
Power Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer	neg
William Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.	neg
Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter	neg
LOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday.	neg
The announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said.	neg
In a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said.	neg
Such sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said.	neg
The DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total.	neg
According to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market.	neg
The state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years.	neg
Davis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices.	neg
The DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said.	neg
The DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric.	neg

Poetry Analysis/ Discussion	neg
Tulips	neg
The tulips are too excitable, it is winter here.	neg
Look how white everything is, how quiet, how snowed-in.	neg
I am learning peacefulness, lying by myself quietly	neg
As the light lies on these white walls, this bed, these hands.	neg
I am nobody; I have nothing to do with explosions.	neg
I have given my name and my day-clothes up to the nurses	neg
And my history to the anesthetist and my body to surgeons.	neg
They have propped my head between the pillow and the sheet-cuff	neg
Like an eye between two white lids that will not shut.	neg
Stupid pupil, it has to take everything in.	neg
The nurses pass and pass, they are no trouble,	neg
They pass the way gulls pass inland in their white caps,	neg
Doing things with their hands, one just the same as another,	neg
So it is impossible to tell how many there are.	neg
My body is a pebble to them, they tend it as water	neg
Tends to the pebbles it must run over, smoothing them gently.	neg
They bring me numbness in their bright needles, they bring me sleep	neg
Now I have lost myself I am sick of baggage	neg
My patent leather overnight case like a black pillbox,	neg
My husband and child smiling out of the family photo;	neg
Their smiles catch onto my skin, little smiling hooks.	neg
I have let things slip, a thirty-year~old cargo boat	neg
Stubbornly hanging on to my name and address.	neg
They have swabbed me clear of my loving associations.	neg
Scared and bare on the green plastic-pillowed trolley	neg
I watched my teaset, my bureaus of linen, my books	neg
Sink out of sight, and the water went over my head.	neg
I am a nun now, I have never been so pure.	neg
I didn't want any flowers, I only wanted	neg
To lie with my hands turned up and be utterly empty.	neg
How free it is, you have no idea how free -	neg
The peacefulness is so big it dazes you,	neg
And it asks nothing, a name tag, a few trinkets.	neg
It is what the dead close on, finally; I imagine them	neg
Shutting their mouths on it, like a Communion tablet.	neg
The tulips are too red in the first place, they hurt me.	neg
Even through the gift paper I could hear them breathe	neg
Lightly, through their white swaddlings, like an awful baby.	neg
Their redness talks to my wound, it corresponds.	neg
They are subtle: they seem to float, though they weigh me down	neg
Upsetting me with their sudden tongues and their color,	neg
A dozen red lead sinkers round my neck.	neg
Nobody watched me before, now I am watched.	neg
The tulips turn to me, and the window behind me	neg
Where once a day the light slowly widens and slowly thins,	neg
And I see myself, flat, ridiculous, a cut-paper shadow	neg
Between the eye of the sun and the eyes of the tulips,	neg
And I have no face, I have wanted to efface myself	neg
The vivid tulips eat my oxygen.	neg
Before they came the air was calm enough,	neg
Coming and going, breath by breath, without any fuss.	neg
Then the tulips filled it up like a loud noise.	neg
Now the air snags and eddies round them the way a river	neg
Snags and eddies round a sunken rust-red engine.	neg
They concentrate my attention, that was happy	neg
Playing and resting without committing itself.	neg
The walls, also, seem to be warming themselves.	neg
The tulips should be behind bars like dangerous animals;	neg
They are opening like the mouth of some great African cat,	neg
And I am aware of my heart: it opens and closes	neg
Its bowl of red blooms out of sheer love of me.	neg
The water I taste is warm and salt, like the sea,	neg
And comes from a country far away as health.	neg

It took more than a few days to catch up after I came back from Australia.	neg
There  are few things I would like to bring up to your attention.	neg
First of all, I would like to thank you for your hospitality. I learned a lot	neg
about Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the	neg
quality of the people at the Sydney office.	neg
1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.	neg
I think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help	neg
you with a phone interview.	neg
2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am	neg
very interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over	neg
to the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.	neg
Can you help us by interviewing him in Sydney?	neg
The main determination I need from you is whether he can	neg
function in a company like Enron. As any good academic	neg
he sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case	neg
you don't have a PostScript reader on your system.	neg
3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on	neg
the weather front. I would like to determine if he can help	neg
us to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston	neg
for a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike	neg
Roberts and Joe Hrgovcic. I think that he could learn a lot	neg
from Mike and other weather guys here how we translate	neg
weather info into business related information. I shall be glad to	neg
underwrite the cost of this trip.	neg

A short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.	neg
I. Projects (in the order they suggested it).	neg
1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market	neg
factors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.	neg
2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without	neg
full trade automation.	neg
3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.	neg
II. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments	neg
per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.	neg
1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of	neg
Enron's participation.	neg
2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.	neg
3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through	neg
fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support	neg
tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify	neg
decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.	neg
Recommendations:	neg
1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.	neg
2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship	neg
with UBS.	neg
3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from	neg
Prediction Company.	neg

Spotlight Report	neg
Exchange products seeing slow trading	neg
GAVIN SOUTER	neg
03/20/2000	neg
Business Insurance	neg
Page 3	neg
Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights	neg
reserved.	neg
Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have	neg
been somewhat slow to get off the ground.	neg
Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since	neg
the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a	neg
significant volume of trades.	neg
Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away	neg
from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains	neg
abundant and relatively cheap.	neg
As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major	neg
natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will	neg
remain limited, observers say.	neg
Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the	neg
limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he	neg
said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one	neg
contract against another.	neg
Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to	neg
establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has	neg
not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,	neg
capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in	neg
New York.	neg
The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not	neg
offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way	neg
to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified	neg
portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently	neg
offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that	neg
hedge, he said.	neg
Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then	neg
hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.	neg
stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane	neg
explained.	neg
The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to	neg
natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he	neg
said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop	neg
indexes, Mr. Lane said. "For the insurance buyer, such exchange	neg
instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but	neg
as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a	neg
good surrogate," he said.	neg
The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for	neg
over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of	neg
catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.	neg
The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of	neg
exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior	neg
vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance	neg
brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.	neg
"The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not	neg
looking for other ways of doing business," he said.	neg
At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar	neg
to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success	neg
since they were introduced in the 1970s. "There is a belief that	neg
alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to	neg
predict when," Mr. Mooney said.	neg
Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves	neg
established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not	neg
brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.	neg
Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities	neg
Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,	neg
however, and was suspended last year after two years of little	neg
activity.	neg
The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative	neg
products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board	neg
of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.	neg
Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft	neg
traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge	neg
catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker	neg
at the CBOT who trades in options.	neg
No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT	neg
so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in	neg
the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were	neg
traded, Mr. Purty said.	neg
"I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they	neg
really take off," he said.	neg
The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to	neg
trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance	neg
markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative	neg
coverage options, Mr. Purty said.	neg
The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has	neg
radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in	neg
mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,	neg
chief operating officer.	neg
CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for	neg
reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks	neg
and to build balanced portfolios.	neg
But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it	neg
was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX	neg
wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney	neg
said.	neg
Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of	neg
risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.	neg
Sweeney said.	neg
Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a "cash for cover"	neg
exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange	neg
include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability	neg
coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where	neg
coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry	neg
loss over an agreed threshold.	neg
Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible	neg
through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX	neg
offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them	neg
form groups whose members do business only with one another.	neg
Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,	neg
totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,	neg
he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,	neg
insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their	neg
captives, Mr. Sweeney said.	neg
"We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied	neg
with what we have achieved so far," Mr. Sweeney said.	neg
The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents	neg
seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their	neg
existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was	neg
a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last	neg
year.	neg
Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field	neg
of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather	neg
derivatives .	neg
Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry	neg
Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.	neg
Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against	neg
weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in	neg
a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a	neg
resultant fall in revenues.	neg
The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,	neg
Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,	neg
Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering	neg
contracts based on cold weather.	neg
Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers	neg
themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more	neg
extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.	neg
In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for	neg
over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.	neg

WN95090	neg
A few comments on the state of our VaR models. The issues always become more	neg
controversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would	neg
like to share with you a few observations.	neg
1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to	neg
Enron (and the P/E ratio).	neg
A number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in	neg
massive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this	neg
crirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and	neg
our strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management	neg
technology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.	neg
It is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can	neg
convince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about	neg
the quality of our financial technology. This can be done	neg
through targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.	neg
by reality.	neg
2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.	neg
The VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input	neg
information as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to	neg
the market observations (as opposed to historical data).	neg
One immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks	neg
information and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.	neg
One should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the	neg
trading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect	neg
between the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices	neg
curves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized	neg
forward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will	neg
systematically fail.	neg
One way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically	neg
fwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the	neg
source of problems we see in some books.	neg
3. VaR process management.	neg
Given the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,	neg
a system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.	neg
What is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality	neg
of the results.	neg
Specifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility	neg
for the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization	neg
and resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have	neg
inputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used	neg
currently in the system are 2 years old.	neg
Another aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view	neg
some recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal	neg
usefulness (and in some case on questionable	neg
understanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to	neg
bring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties	neg
and	neg

Enron Paid Out 'Retention' Bonuses Before Bankruptcy Filing	neg
December 6, 2001	neg
By RICHARD A. OPPEL Jr. and KURT EICHENWALD	neg
Just days before Enron (news/quote) filed for bankruptcy	neg
and laid off 4,000 people, it paid out $55 million in	neg
bonuses to about 500 employees, according to several people	neg
who had dealings with the company.	neg
Yesterday evening, an Enron spokesman confirmed the	neg
bonuses, describing them as "retention incentives" for	neg
crucial employees. Bankruptcy experts said that the	neg
payments were almost certain to be closely scrutinized -	neg
and probably challenged - by Enron's creditors.	neg
Separately, the Labor Department said yesterday that it had	neg
opened an investigation into how Enron managed its	neg
employees' 401(k) retirement plans. Those accounts were	neg
heavily invested in Enron shares, and company rules	neg
prohibited many employees from diversifying their holdings.	neg
The Labor Department said that employees had lost up to 90	neg
percent of the value of their accounts.	neg
"Enron's employees have gotten the short end of the stick	neg
in the sudden collapse of this company," said Labor	neg
Secretary Elaine L. Chao. Enron has said that a temporary	neg
freeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement	neg
investments was long planned and allowed another company to	neg
take over the job of administering the plan.	neg
Enron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses, who	neg
received the money or what the range of payments was.	neg
Executives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such	neg
payments as necessary if there is to be any hope of	neg
reorganizing as a going concern. But they often prove to be	neg
incendiary. For example, in 1990, when it was disclosed	neg
that Drexel Burnham Lambert had paid key executives some	neg
$250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy,	neg
creditors and the government reacted with outrage. In the	neg
end, after court hearings on the issue, the Drexel estate	neg
sued the employees to get the money back.	neg
The payments by Enron "are substantially high, and that	neg
means it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy	neg
case," said James Feder, a bankruptcy lawyer with Feder &	neg
Mills, a law firm in Los Angeles. "The question might come	neg
up as to whether there was fair consideration given for the	neg
amount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable	neg
under the circumstances."	neg
If creditors can convince the court that the employees were	neg
overpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out	neg
of creditors' hands, a much more difficult argument to	neg
prove - then the judge can void the payments and order the	neg
money returned, said Lynn LoPucki, a law professor at the	neg
University of California at Los Angeles.	neg
To tamp down such disputes, a company typically will file a	neg
request, as part of its bankruptcy filing, to make payments	neg
to certain employees, and not proceed with the payments	neg
until receiving a judge's approval, Mr. LoPucki said.	neg
Yesterday, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, defended the	neg
payments as necessary "in order to protect and maintain the	neg
value of the estate." Such payments "are done in every	neg
bankruptcy," he said, adding that the payments were made to	neg
employees "at all levels of the organization."	neg
Employees who lost their jobs after Enron filed for	neg
bankruptcy protection on Sunday were told they may receive	neg
no more than $4,500 in severance pay. They also were told	neg
to petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation	neg
days.	neg
In another legal slap at Enron, a shareholder lawsuit filed	neg
late Tuesday accused 29 Enron officers and directors of	neg
engaging in "massive insider trading" and making "false and	neg
misleading" statements about the company's financial	neg
performance while selling about $1.1 billion worth of stock	neg
over the last three years.	neg
An Enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit, which	neg
was filed by Amalgamated Bank, which is known to be an	neg
activist shareholder.	neg

CNN) -- Seven airport security workers have been suspended after police said a man made it through a security checkpoint at Chicago's O'Hare International Airport with knives, a can of Mace and a stun gun.	neg
Security screeners took two knives from Subash Gurung, 27, after he initially went through the checkpoint Saturday night, authorities said. Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said.	neg
The suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond.	neg
CNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>)	neg
In the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified.	neg
After a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west.	neg
There were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar.	neg
Taliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.	neg

I wish I could take credit for the link success but none of the things I was	neg
trying were what actually did it.  Seems that if you copy from Netscape and	neg
paste into this e-mail system it happens automatically.	neg
Now this one is actually the result of extra geek effort on my part.	neg

Here are the issues I see with their draft:	neg
Does not allow for us to sell them power, only buy their power and sell to	neg
others. This means that we can't sell them power until we get the full	neg
contract in place.	neg
Fuel transactions include fuel oil, and I thought we weren't managing fuel	neg
oil.	neg
Incentive fee (in main contract) defined to only include the sale of gas.	neg
Doesn't include the language we need for internal approvals.	neg
Payment section doesn't address payment for sale of power to them from the	neg
market.	neg

I received your request regarding the contingent beneficiary for your father's life insurance, SIP, SAPP and Voluntary Cash Deferral Plan. Unfortunately, Ayco does not have access to this information. For all of these types of requests, Marsh has asked that the requesting party send a letter to Marsh & McLennan to the special UP.OF. Box that has been set up:	neg

There is only one Susan Scott at Enron that really matters, right?  Best ways to ensure it's me...either use sscott5@enron.com or check to make sure the middle initial that pops up is "M".	neg
