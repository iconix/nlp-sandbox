Will I get paid the retention bonus absent voluntary termination (i.e. for both with cause and without cause involuntary termination) ?\n \n3) Who will be my employer?  And will all stock and stock option grants be in UBS AG stock?\n \n4) What happens to the Restricted Stock grant referenced in Section 2 and again in Exhibit I if UBS terminates me with or without cause?  As a follow up,  if the stock is lost then what is the consideration for signing this contract (non - compete)?\n \n5) In Section 9(a), the non - compete clause is set up for a 12 month period after my employment begins and continues regardless of termination both voluntarily and involuntarily.  What is to stop UBS from terminating me or anyone else for that matter immediately after signing this agreement?

Please let me know if there are others I missed, or if there are changes needed to the ones listed.\n\n  \n1.\tRetroactive Suspension of DA Contracts:  The PUC rules in a subsequent decision that DA is suspended on some date \tbetween July 1 and September 20th.  \n\n2.\tContract renewal forbidden:  The PUC includes contract renewal under the suspension of DA.\n\n3.\tNo incremental \"DASR'ing\":  The PUC includes incremental additions and subtractions of DA customer's load under the \tsuspension of DA (e.g., fast food chains, University campus)\n\n4.\tCost allocation: the PUC adds new costs to DA accounts and/or disproportionately shifts existing costs to DA accounts.  \tCosts with greatest risk of being shifted to DA customers include: IOU undercollection, bonds to repay the state general fund, \tand DWR contracts.  The costs associated with these categories are substantial. \n\nKey risks associated with each category:\nAdverse to P/L \nAdverse to hedge (demand risk)\n",

In convening the session, the Governor must issue a proclamation outlining the reasons for the special session, and only issues specified in the proclamation may be acted upon. \nElection of Special Session Officers, Committees and Bill Referrals: \nThe election of officers and the appointment of special session committees are separate from the Legislature's regular session. In some instances, special session committees are comprised of different committee members than those appointed to regular session committees. \nIdentification of Special Session Bills and Publications: \nSeparate record-keeping publications (File, History, Journal and Roll Call) are printed for each individual extraordinary session. Special session bills are identified by specific paper colors (i.e. blue or green). For example, documents in the 2001 Second Extraordinary Session are printed on green paper. \nIntroduction of Special Session Bills: \nThere is no limit to the number of bills that a member of the Legislature may introduce during the extraordinary session, and none of the bills introduced during the extraordinary session count toward the member's bill limit in the Regular Session. \nSpecial Session Bill Procedures and Calendars: \nThere is no bill introduction deadline during special sessions, and the \"30-day in print\" rule and committee file notice requirements do not apply. Special session bills also are not subject to the regular legislative session calendar, committee and/or floor deadlines. The sine die deadline requiring session to adjourn on November 30 of the second year of a legislative session does apply to the Special Session. \nEffective Date of Special Session Legislation: \nSimple majority vote special session bills take effect on the 91st day after the special session is adjourned. Urgency measures and other two-thirds majority-vote bills take effect immediately upon the Governor's signature. The Governor has 12 days from the date it is received on his desk to sign or veto legislation. Similar to the Regular Session, a special session bill may become law without the Governor's signature. \nEnd of Special Session: \nOnly the Legislature, by concurrent resolution, may end a special session. The concurrent resolution takes effect upon passage by both houses of the Legislature, and is not subject to a Governor's signature or veto. ",

Note below that even the mighty and powerful Power Authority's own crackerjack analysis asserts that there is still a net short (despite DWR contracts and DA \"stampede\"), which should leave one to believe that, contrary to Angelides' letter, the more the DA the better. Which further supports Loretta Lynch's response to the Angelides' letter that DA reduces the amount of spot power DWR has to buy.\nBest,\nJeff\nCONSUMER POWER AND CONSERVATION FINANCING AUTHORITY \nPace of Power Authority Renewable Portfolio Agenda is Slowed \nQuite possibly the most significant action taken at the October 19 Consumer Power and Conservation Financing Authority (Power Authority) was its inaction on contracts proposed for approval. The Power Authority has aggressively pursued a broad renewable portfolio, with the intent to approve contracts as soon as possible. \nInstead of approving a number of contracts on its October 19 agenda, the Power Authority deferred calendared decisions on request for bids until its November 2 meeting, acknowledging that no action can be taken until the Department of Water Resources (DWR) rate agreement stalemate has been resolved. \nChairman Freeman stated that the Public Utility Commission's rejection of the rate agreement has created an obstacle for the Power Authority to exercise renewable contracts, to contract for peaker generation and/or to implement demand side programs. The Power Authority relies upon DWR's credit to fund these programs, and until a rate agreement is finalized the Power Authority cannot sign contracts. \nFreeman indicated that the Power Authority has signed letters of intent to purchase output from 14 biomass facilities in the Central Valley, as well as 400 MW generated by wind. \nWith the Current Glut of Contracts, Why Do We Need Additional Reserves? \nKellan Flukinger, Senior Advisor to Chairman Freeman and Laura Doll, provided a detailed presentation explaining why he believes the Power Authority must contract for additional renewable and peaking generation. Flukinger believes that despite direct access and the current glut of electricity supplied in long-term contracts, there still appears to be a net short of a few thousand megawatts within the State. \nFlukinger concluded that the State still is at the mercy of electric generators who are not subject to PUC regulatory authority and who have no real obligation to build and maintain new facilities or to serve customers within the State. He believes that the short-term contracts and spot purchases leave the state vulnerable to price-spikes and supply shortages. He believes that the reserve can be managed through Time-of-Use and Real-Time-Pricing, conservation, interruptibles, demand side management, renewables and peakers. \nPower Authority Names William Barry as Chief Financial Officer \nWilliam Barry was approved as Chief Financial Officer of the Power Authority at its October 19 Board meeting in Sacramento. Mr. Barry currently works for the City of San Francisco, and has worked in the past for the New York Power Authority.",

    "Content": "Calif Resells Surplus Power At A Loss In Second Quarter\n \nLOS ANGELES -(Dow Jones)- The California agency buying power in lieu of the state's ailing utilities resold electricity in the spot market during the second quarter at an average price of $45 a megawatt-hour, the agency said Wednesday. \n\nThe announcement by the California Department of Water Resources was an answer to critics who blasted the department this summer for having to resell surplus power for as little as $1 a megawatt-hour because it secured too much electricity under long-term contracts negotiated by the administration of Gov. Gray Davis, the department said. \n\nIn a press release, the department's California Energy Resources Scheduling division, its power-marketing arm, said it resold 224,871 megawatt-hours, or 1.1% of its total purchases. That power generally was first bought on the spot market or through monthly or quarterly contracts, not the long-term contracts, the department said. \n\nSuch sales are typical of any power-buying operation, as demand for electricity can vary in unpredictable ways, the department said. \n\nThe DWR is responsible for buying all the power needed by the customers of the state's three main utilities beyond what the utilities generate themselves or have secured under their own long-term contracts - or about one-third of the total. \n\nAccording to the DWR, power secured under Davis' long-term contracts covers one-third to one-half of the electricity it must supply. Short-term deals, such as monthly or quarterly contracts, represent one-third of the portfolio. The rest is bought in the spot market. \n\nThe state has put its average cost of power under the long-term contracts at 7.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the first five years and 6.9 cents per kilowatt-hour for the next five years. \n\nDavis has taken heat for locking up too much electricity at high prices. Similarly, the Department of Water Resources has been criticized for amateurish purchasing practices. \n\nThe DWR releases information on its power transactions quarterly to protect its negotiating position, the department said. \n\nThe DWR buys power for customers of PG&E Corp. (PCG) unit Pacific Gas & Electric, Edison International (EIX) unit Southern California Edison and Sempra Energy (SRE) unit San Diego Gas & Electric. ",

I learned a lot\nabout Australian markets and was greatly impressed with the\nquality of the people at the Sydney office.\n\n1. The resume you sent to me and Grant looks quite good.\nI think it makes sense to interview this person and we can help\nyou with a phone interview.\n\n2. I have received another resume that looks very promising. I am\nvery interested in this guy and would be ready to bring him over\nto the States  where we lack desperately technical talent.\nCan you help us by interviewing him in Sydney? \nThe main determination I need from you is whether he can\nfunction in a company like Enron. As any good academic\nhe sent his resume in a ps format and I shall fax you a copy in case\nyou don't have a PostScript reader on your system.\n\n3. Christian Werner does some really neat things on\nthe weather front. I would like to determine if he can help\nus to upgrade our systems. Can we bring him to Houston\nfor a week to discuss the weather forecasting  technology with  Mike \nRoberts and Joe Hrgovcic. I think that he could learn a lot\nfrom Mike and other weather guys here how we translate \nweather info into business related information. I shall be glad to\nunderwrite the cost of this trip.\n\nVince\n",

    "Content": "Greg,\n\nA short summary of the proposed modes of cooperation with Prediction Company.\n\nI. Projects (in the order they suggested it).\n\n\t1. Prediction Company develops a P&L attribution system (allocation of P&L to different market\n\tfactors, like spreads, volume, trader's skills, etc.). Trader's performance evaluation system.\n\n\t2. Decision support system: a model recommending transactions to a trader without\n\tfull trade automation.\n\n\t3. Fully automated trading system, setting prices and executing trades on an electronic trading platform.\n \nII. Financial arrangements. Combination of a number of different forms of equity participation, direct payments \n   per project on completion, and   fees per transaction.\n\n\t1. Equity investment would reduce fees and payments. For Prediction Company, this is a preferred form of \n\t    Enron's participation.\n\n\t2. Payment per project would look like consulting fees.\n\n\t3. Next to equity investment, they would like to see a constant income stream through\n\t    fees charged per transaction. My comment: in case they design a decision support\n\t    tool, it will be difficult to come up with a per transaction fee. It will be difficult to identify\n\t    decisions that can be attributed exclusively to their system.\n\n\nRecommendations:\n\n\t1. A visit to Santa Fe with Kevin Garland to discuss an equity investment.\n\n\t2. I shall try to dig up more information about the company and the relationship\n                with UBS.\n\n\t3. We should  come up with a solution that will help to transfer skills to Enron from\n\t    Prediction Company.\n",

    "Content": "Spotlight Report\n  Exchange products seeing slow trading\n  GAVIN SOUTER\n\n  03/20/2000\n  Business Insurance\n  Page 3\n  Copyright (C) 2000 Crain Communications, Inc. All rights\n  reserved.\n\n  Exchange-based insurance products developed in recent years have\n  been somewhat slow to get off the ground.\n\n  Although several exchanges have offered derivative contracts since\n  the mid-1990s to cover insurance risks, none so far has posted a\n  significant volume of trades.\n\n  Few insurers, reinsurers or policyholders have been drawn away\n  from the traditional insurance markets, where capacity remains\n  abundant and relatively cheap.\n\n  As long as those traditional markets manage to weather major\n  natural catastrophes, the allure of the exchange-based products will\n  remain limited, observers say.\n\n  Also stifling the growth of the exchange-based contracts is the\n  limited number of contracts available, one expert noted. Dealers, he\n  said, are unable to secure a suitable hedge by laying off one\n  contract against another.\n\n  Although the various exchanges have had a good opportunity to\n  establish a widely used set of new risk financing products, that has\n  not been achieved, said Morton Lane, senior managing director,\n  capital markets division at Gerling Global Financial Products in\n  New York.\n\n  The main problem with the existing exchanges is that they do not\n  offer a sufficiently diverse array of products, he said. The only way\n  to control the risks in the catastrophe options is to have a diversified\n  portfolio of other contracts, and none of the exchanges currently\n  offers a sufficiently broad range of options to provide for that\n  hedge, he said.\n\n  Florida windstorm options, for example, cannot be bought and then\n  hedged in the same way that International Business Machines Corp.\n  stock options contracts can be hedged with IBM stock, Mr. Lane\n  explained.\n\n  The exchanges might be more attractive to investors if, in addition to\n  natural catastrophe options, they included options on other risks, he\n  said. Those might include, for example, satellite, aviation and crop\n  indexes, Mr. Lane said. \"For the insurance buyer, such exchange\n  instruments would not represent the perfect risk transfer vehicle, but\n  as long as they are quantifiable and indexable, they may represent a\n  good surrogate,\" he said.\n\n  The exchanges could also be used to create a derivatives market for\n  over-the-counter securitized deals, if there are regular issuers of\n  catastrophe bonds, Mr. Lane said.\n\n  The soft insurance market has also hindered the growth of\n  exchange-based insurance products, said Sean F. Mooney, senior\n  vp and chief economist at Guy Carpenter & Co., the reinsurance\n  brokerage unit of Marsh Inc. in New York.\n\n  \"The traditional market has been so competitive that people are not\n  looking for other ways of doing business,\" he said.\n\n  At least in concept, the exchange-based deals are generally similar\n  to the mortgage-backed securities that have been a huge success\n  since they were introduced in the 1970s. \"There is a belief that\n  alternative means of transferring risks will grow, but it is difficult to\n  predict when,\" Mr. Mooney said.\n\n  Currently, the trading that is taking place typically involves\n  established insurers and reinsurers, so the exchanges have not\n  brought substantial new capacity to the marketplace, he said.\n\n  Guy Carpenter provided the index for the Bermuda Commodities\n  Exchange reinsurance products. The BCE did not take off,\n  however, and was suspended last year after two years of little\n  activity.\n\n  The oldest of the insurance-related, exchange-based derivative\n  products are the catastrophe options traded on the Chicago Board\n  of Trade, which began trading the options in 1996.\n\n  Initially, there was substantial interest in the options, but the soft\n  traditional market has hampered use of the contracts to hedge\n  catastrophe exposures, said Carlton Purty, an independent broker\n  at the CBOT who trades in options.\n\n  No catastrophe option trades have been completed at the CBOT\n  so far this year, he said. Last year, there was increased interest in\n  the contracts because of Hurricane Floyd, but few contracts were\n  traded, Mr. Purty said.\n\n  \"I think a major, major catastrophe will have to happen before they\n  really take off,\" he said.\n\n  The contracts offer real protection, and options dealers are keen to\n  trade in a new niche, but the conventional insurance and reinsurance\n  markets are so soft that few companies are turning to alternative\n  coverage options, Mr. Purty said.\n\n  The Catastrophe Risk Exchange, located in Princeton, N.J., has\n  radically changed its structure since it was originally announced in\n  mid-1996, and it is well positioned to expand, said Frank Sweeney,\n  chief operating officer.\n\n  CATEX initially planned to be a computer-based facility for\n  reinsurers that would enable them to exchange catastrophe risks\n  and to build balanced portfolios.\n\n  But by the time the exchange was operational in November 1996, it\n  was clear that most reinsurers and insurers interested in CATEX\n  wanted only to buy and sell conventional reinsurance, Mr. Sweeney\n  said.\n\n  Although there was some interest in risk swapping, only a handful of\n  risks were posted on the system, and none was traded, Mr.\n  Sweeney said.\n\n  Consequently, CATEX has become chiefly a \"cash for cover\"\n  exchange, he said, noting that the risks reinsured on the exchange\n  include property catastrophe coverage, aviation and liability\n  coverages. CATEX also trades industry loss warranties, where\n  coverage is triggered by an actual loss combined with an industry\n  loss over an agreed threshold.\n\n  Other adjustments to the exchange included making it accessible\n  through the Internet in November 1998. And late last year, CATEX\n  offered users the ability to set up smaller networks, allowing them\n  form groups whose members do business only with one another.\n\n  Since its inception, CATEX has completed about 450 trades,\n  totaling $400 million in premium and more than $3 billion in limits,\n  he said. CATEX's roughly 160 subscribers include reinsurers,\n  insurers and corporate entities that purchase coverage through their\n  captives, Mr. Sweeney said.\n\n  \"We obviously have a long way to go, but we are pretty satisfied\n  with what we have achieved so far,\" Mr. Sweeney said.\n\n  The exchange sees increased activity after major losses, as cedents\n  seek to buy replacement coverage to offset depletions in their\n  existing cover, he said. For example, Mr. Sweeney said, there was\n  a flurry of activity after the European windstorms in December last\n  year.\n\n  Last September, the Chicago Mercantile Exchange entered the field\n  of insurance-related derivatives when it began offering weather\n  derivatives .\n\n  Thus far, 420 futures contracts have been traded, said Larry\n  Grannan, senior director in product marketing at the CME.\n\n  Such contracts are designed to allow businesses to hedge against\n  weather-related losses. For example, a utility may sell less power in\n  a mild winter, and it would be able to use the futures to hedge a\n  resultant fall in revenues.\n\n  The exchange first offered heat-based indexes for Atlanta, Chicago,\n  Cincinnati and New York. In January, it added Philadelphia, Dallas,\n  Des Moines, Las Vegas, Tucson and Portland, and it began offering\n  contracts based on cold weather.\n\n  Currently, most of the trades are between securities dealers\n  themselves, but, eventually, the contracts will likely be used more\n  extensively by utilities and insurers, Mr. Grannan said.\n\n  In addition, the futures contracts could be used as hedges for\n  over-the-counter securitized deals, he said.\n\n\n\n\nCopyright , 2000 Dow Jones & Company, Inc.

The issues always become more\ncontroversial during the periods when vols and positions increase and I would\nlike to share with you a few observations.\n\n1. Critical importance of a  good risk management system to\nEnron (and the P/E ratio).\n\nA number of recent analysts' reports characterized Enron as a hedge fund engaged in\nmassive directional trading and representing huge risks to investors. One way to counter this\ncrirticism is to emphasize the quality of Enron's risk amnageemnt system and\nour strong risk amangeemnt culture.  Our claims regarding the strong risk management\ntechnology and culture should be, however, supported  by reality.\n\nIt is critical that we continue to improve our risk management systems and also can\nconvince the external parties (stock analysts, creditors,  credit rating agencies) about\nthe quality of our financial technology. This can be done \nthrough targeted disclosure of the elements of our technology, as we have done frequently in the past.\nby reality.\n\n2. Inputs from the trading desks vs. historical calibration.\n\nThe VaR system used in Enron is based on the assumption that as much input\ninformation as possible should come from the market (i.e. trading desks), or should be calibrated to\nthe market observations (as opposed to historical data).\n\nOne immediate improvement: we should review inputs that are not based on the trading desks\ninformation and move, if possible, to replace them with market based, forward looking data.\n\nOne should not assume, of course, that the information coming from the\ntrading desks is perfect. One problem that is persistent in some portfolios is the disconnect\nbetween the posted forward vols curves and subsequent fluctuations in the forward prices \ncurves. The forward vols curves should be relatively unbiased expectations of future realized \nforward price volati;oty. If this is not the case, back testing for some portfolios will \nsystematically fail. \n\nOne way to address the problem is to implement a module that compares systematically\nfwd vols posted by the trading desks with subsequent price movements. It will allow us to identify the \nsource of problems we see in some books.\n\n3. VaR process management.\n\nGiven the size of our trading operation, we are running a VaR factory,\na system designed to produce timely risk assessment for all the portfolios.\nWhat is missing is the industrial type process that guarantees the quality\nof the results.\n\nSpecifically, I am concerned about absence of one person vested with the responsibility\nfor the model calibration. Right now this responsibility is dispersed in the organization\nand resides somewhere between the IT, RAC and Research. As a result we have\ninputs updated inconsistently and without proper quality controls. Some inputs used \ncurrently in the system are 2 years old.\n\nAnother aspect of this problem is prioritization of different projects. In my view \nsome recent modification to the system tied up IT resources and were of marginal\nusefulness (and in some case on questionable\nunderstanding of mathematics). Of course, I can be wrong but there is was no systematic process to\nbring these issues to the table, in a meeting involving all the concerned parties\n\nand ",

OPPEL Jr. and KURT EICHENWALD\n\n\n\n\nJust days before Enron (news/quote) filed for bankruptcy\nand laid off 4,000 people, it paid out $55 million in\nbonuses to about 500 employees, according to several people\nwho had dealings with the company.\n\nYesterday evening, an Enron spokesman confirmed the\nbonuses, describing them as \"retention incentives\" for\ncrucial employees. Bankruptcy experts said that the\npayments were almost certain to be closely scrutinized -\nand probably challenged - by Enron's creditors.\n\nSeparately, the Labor Department said yesterday that it had\nopened an investigation into how Enron managed its\nemployees' 401(k) retirement plans. Those accounts were\nheavily invested in Enron shares, and company rules\nprohibited many employees from diversifying their holdings.\nThe Labor Department said that employees had lost up to 90\npercent of the value of their accounts.\n\n\"Enron's employees have gotten the short end of the stick\nin the sudden collapse of this company,\" said Labor\nSecretary Elaine L. Chao. Enron has said that a temporary\nfreeze that kept some employees from shifting retirement\ninvestments was long planned and allowed another company to\ntake over the job of administering the plan.\n\nEnron declined to say how much was paid out in bonuses, who\nreceived the money or what the range of payments was.\n\nExecutives of companies entering bankruptcy defend such\npayments as necessary if there is to be any hope of\nreorganizing as a going concern. But they often prove to be\nincendiary. For example, in 1990, when it was disclosed\nthat Drexel Burnham Lambert had paid key executives some\n$250 million in bonuses before filing for bankruptcy,\ncreditors and the government reacted with outrage. In the\nend, after court hearings on the issue, the Drexel estate\nsued the employees to get the money back.\n\nThe payments by Enron \"are substantially high, and that\nmeans it probably does become an issue in the bankruptcy\ncase,\" said James Feder, a bankruptcy lawyer with Feder &\nMills, a law firm in Los Angeles. \"The question might come\nup as to whether there was fair consideration given for the\namount of these bonuses and whether they were reasonable\nunder the circumstances.\"\n\nIf creditors can convince the court that the employees were\noverpaid - or that the payments were made to keep money out\nof creditors' hands, a much more difficult argument to\nprove - then the judge can void the payments and order the\nmoney returned, said Lynn LoPucki, a law professor at the\nUniversity of California at Los Angeles.\n\nTo tamp down such disputes, a company typically will file a\nrequest, as part of its bankruptcy filing, to make payments\nto certain employees, and not proceed with the payments\nuntil receiving a judge's approval, Mr. LoPucki said.\n\nYesterday, Mark Palmer, an Enron spokesman, defended the\npayments as necessary \"in order to protect and maintain the\nvalue of the estate.\" Such payments \"are done in every\nbankruptcy,\" he said, adding that the payments were made to\nemployees \"at all levels of the organization.\"\n\nEmployees who lost their jobs after Enron filed for\nbankruptcy protection on Sunday were told they may receive\nno more than $4,500 in severance pay. They also were told\nto petition the bankruptcy court to cash in unused vacation\ndays.\n\nIn another legal slap at Enron, a shareholder lawsuit filed\nlate Tuesday accused 29 Enron officers and directors of\nengaging in \"massive insider trading\" and making \"false and\nmisleading\" statements about the company's financial\nperformance while selling about $1.1 billion worth of stock\nover the last three years.\n\nAn Enron spokesman declined to comment on the suit, which\nwas filed by Amalgamated Bank, which is known to be an\nactivist shareholder.\n\nhttp://www.nytimes.com/2001/12/06/business/06ENRO.html?ex=1008791402&ei=1&en=3f3df31ea6577ab2\n\n\n\nHOW TO ADVERTISE\n---------------------------------\nFor information on advertising in e-mail newsletters\nor other creative advertising opportunities with The\nNew York Times on the Web, please contact Alyson\nRacer at alyson@nytimes.com or visit our online media\nkit at http://www.nytimes.com/adinfo\n\nFor general information about NYTimes.com, write to\nhelp@nytimes.com.\n\nCopyright 2001 The New York Times Company",

Gurung then was allowed to pass through. Seven more knives, Mace and a stun gun were found in his carry-on luggage during a random search before boarding a United Airlines flight, police said. \nThe suspect, who told authorities he is from Nepal, was arrested Sunday night by the FBI and will be arraigned Monday on a federal charge of unlawfully taking a weapon aboard an aircraft. He originally had been arrested Saturday by local police, charged with two misdemeanors and released on bond. \nCNN has learned of a possible connection between Gurung and a man who is being held as a material witness in the September 11 terrorist attacks. Gurung listed the same West Hollywood Avenue address in Chicago as the detainee. (Full story </2001/US/11/05/inv.ohare.security.breach/index.html>) \nIn the U.S.-led retaliation for the terror attacks, Taliban forces were leaving their southern Afghan stronghold of Kandahar on Monday as U.S.-led airstrikes intensified. \nAfter a quiet day Sunday -- allied planes dropped a single bomb southeast of the city -- CNN's Kamal Hyder reported heavy bombardment of rural districts around Kandahar as well as military targets to the northeast, southeast and west. \nThere were reports of further attacks overnight on the Kajaki Dam area, where a hydroelectric plant is located that provides power to Kandahar. \nTaliban frontline positions north of Kabul also were hit Monday, and there were reports of intense fighting near the strategic northern city of Mazar-e Sharif.
